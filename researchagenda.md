  I research the psychology of media and technology. Since I outlined a research agenda for prosociality with and through interactive media (Ng, 2016), I have been especially interested in understanding human reciprocity and cooperation with/through interactive media technologies, including but not limited to artificial intelligence (AI) media and social media. <br />

**Reciprocity and Cooperation with Interactive Media Technologies (AI Media)** <br /> 
<br /> 
  I have investigated interactive media technologies that people can adopt social rules and expectations to communicate and interact with, i.e., communicative AI media. I conducted a prisoner’s dilemma experiment on human–communicative AI cooperation to examine the relevant social dilemma problems (Ng, 2023b). Furthermore, sophisticated social cues and cognitive heuristics elicited by AI could direct people to use social rules and expectations for not only initial interactions with AI, but also downstream interactions with people. Accordingly, I conducted a representative survey exploring the conversational AI use–social capital association (Ng, 2024a). <br />

<br /> 
  My student and I employed ecologically valid social media data to identify motivations and relevant topics regarding human–AI interaction in a natural setting. We examined user conversations on Reddit, a social mediated community of practice, to understand how users collaboratively discuss technical and societal issues and concerns (Lin & Ng, In press) and learn how to practice better (Ng & Lin, 2022). Extending these findings, I constructed an integrated longitudinal model to test functional and motivational factors impacting trust in and use of conversational AI (Ng, In press). Besides acceptance of conversational AI, I also investigated passenger acceptance of AI-enabled autonomous vehicles in the driverless dilemma, one of the real-life scenarios of social dilemmas (Ng, 2024b). <br />

  To conclude, the above studies could contribute to the moral machine/reciprocal AI literature at a broader level. <br />

**Reciprocity and Cooperation through Interactive Media Technologies (Social Media)** <br /> 
<br /> 
  Apart from comprehending human–communicative AI cooperation, I have been studying human–human reciprocity and cooperation through social media. It has been argued that, compared with other species, humans are extremely ecologically successful because of their large ingroup cooperation. I reviewed some social media research and proposed that humans have evolved to cooperate with others, and they now utilize social media to execute ingroup cooperation, including getting and giving emotional support, sharing knowledge, and achieving common goals (Ng, 2020a). I empirically found that social media use, particularly active use, increased the perceived relatedness of people in need and decreased the influence of genetic relatedness in aiding (Ng, 2020b). <br />

<br /> 
  Besides ingroup reciprocity through social media, my colleagues and I studied reciprocity with outgroup people through social media. Specifically, we examined supportive expressions in discussions on outgroups by ingroup members (Ng et al., 2022). <br />

<br /> 
  Extending my interest from reciprocity with ingroup and outgroup humans to outgroup species through digital media, I also study the human–nature relationship in a digital context. According to Edward Wilson’s biophilia hypothesis, humans have evolved to affiliate with nature and other species. By integrating the uses and gratifications approach with the biophilia hypothesis, I coined the term biophilia gratification as the psychological need to affiliate with mediated nature. I have conducted three studies to empirically test biophilia gratification. First, a survey was conducted to test the uses and gratifications of mediated nature and associated interdependence with nature and pro-environmental behavior (Ng, 2022a). Second, my student and I computationally analyzed three million Facebook posts (including 10% imaged-based posts) to test whether user reactions reflect biophilia gratification derived from human-created nature on mediated 2.0 (Ng & Lin, In press). Third, studying the human–nature relationship through not only social media but also digital games, I investigated gaming gratifications of biophilic simulation games designed to simulate natural environments (Ng, In press). To conclude, the empirical studies imply that biophilia gratification can benefit the human–nature relationship. <br />

<br /> 
  Apart from the above research topics, I have also studied psychological and social antecedents and consequences of interacting with and through various media technologies, including surveillance technology (Ng & Lin, 2024), deepfakes (Ng, 2023a), virtual and augmented reality (Ng, Ma, et al., 2019), sensational news (Ng & Zhao, 2020), online incivility (Ng et al., 2020), and digital divide (Ng, Chan, et al., 2019). <br />
